Used Code and Examples for the seminar thesis "Adversarial Attacks"

Disclaimer: The folder data includes all used example images used for Adversarial Example generation.
All images were taken by myself, so no copyrights were infringed for these pictures.

For the implementation of a model the The Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) by Goodfellow et al. (2015) was chosen, which is discussed in the corresponding seminar paper in chapter 5.1.

For this purpose, several images were altered using a range of different epsilon values. Subsequently, the output of the classification was compared with the corresponding originals and the success rate was determined.
